// If the React community embraces [hooks],
// it will reduce the number of
// concepts you need to juggle
// when writing React applications.
//  Hooks let you always use functions
//   instead of having to constantly switch
//    between functions, classes, higher-order components, and render props.

// Sharing Non-Visual Logic => Timer
// Using Hooks with Redux

// ✔️ How we managing state has become easier to reason about
// ✔️ Our code is significantly simplified, and more readable
// ✔️ It’s easier to extract and share stateful logic in our apps.

// Hooks solve a wide variety of
// seemingly unconnected problems in React
// that we’ve encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens
// of thousands of components. Whether you’re learning React, use it daily,
// or even prefer a different library with a similar component model,
// you might recognize some of these problems.

// It’s hard to reuse stateful logic between components
